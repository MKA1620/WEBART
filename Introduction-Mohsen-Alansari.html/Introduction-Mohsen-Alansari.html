        <h1>Class Introduction</h1>
       
<h2>
    My name is Mohsen Alansari
</h2>
<h2>My main practices are digtial painting, concept design, 3D sculpting and painting, sound design, character design, film, and video game design.</h2>
<h2>I don't have a favorite color. I think what makes colors unique is that they need each other to enhance one another, which is what makes them look so good.</h2>


<h2>I'm excited to see what kind of stuff I'm going to be making this semester...but</h2>

<h2>I'm not particularly excited about managing 4 studio courses</h2>

<h2>I recommend an icecream shop right next to maclean center across the street. Pretty crouded at times, but it's open til 11 pm.</h2>
